Yes, today.\n\n**Two voting FOMC members** have said the payroll jobs data is overstated.\n\nAnd no, this isn’t some Econ 101 dropout yelling “the numbers are fake” from his parents’ basement. This is coming straight from the Federal Reserve.\n\nI’ve got the receipts.\n\nOh, and one of those two voters?  \n**Jerome Powell**. The Fed Chair himself.\n\n=====\n\nOn **December 10, 2025**, during his [FOMC press conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko-_yb2UkDk) (The Fed’s official YT channel), Powell said:\n\n>Gradual cooling in the labor market has continued. Unemployment is now up three-tenths from June through September. Payroll jobs averaging 40,000 per month since April. We think there’s an **overstatement in these numbers by about 60,000**, so that would be negative 20,000 per month.\n\nThe payroll jobs data is overstated.  \nBy a lot. Roughly **60,000 jobs per month**.\n\nThe BLS says we’re adding +40k jobs per month.  \nWhile the Fed is: “Cool story, bro. But you’re actually down –20k.”\n\nSame energy as what you tell women you make, versus what actually shows up in your bank account.\n\nNow, later in the same press conference, [Powell added](https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20251210.pdf) (The Fed’s own transcript):\n\n>It’s very difficult to estimate job growth in real time. They don’t count everybody. They have a survey. And there’s been something of a **systematic overcount**. And so we expect it and they correct it twice a year.\n\n>So the last time they corrected it, we thought the correction would be 800,000 or 900,000. I won’t get the numbers exactly right. And that was exactly what happened.\n\n>So we think that that has persisted. And so there was an overcount in the payroll job numbers, we think, **continuing**.\n\n>And it will be corrected. I don’t have the exact month in my head right now.\n\nPowell is referring to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and its two annual corrections:\n\n* The **preliminary benchmark revision**.\n* And the **final benchmark revision**.\n\nThe [preliminary benchmark revision](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/prebmk.nr0.htm) was released on **September 9, 2025**.\n\nPowell said the Fed expected a correction of “800,000 or 900,000.”  \nThe actual number? **-911,000**.\n\nWhat the Fed anticipated is *exactly* what happened.\n\nMore importantly, Powell said this discrepancy has **persisted**. The overcount didn’t stop. It didn’t get fixed. Which means the **final benchmark revision will most likely confirm another significant downward correction**.\n\nPowell didn’t have the exact month in his head.  \nI do.\n\nThe final benchmark revision is released alongside the **January 2026 Employment Situation report**.\n\n=====\n\n# It’s Not Just Powell\n\nNow fast-forward.  \nOn **January 30, 2026**, Fed Governor Christopher J. Waller [released a statement](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20260130a.htm):\n\n>Labor market remains weak. Despite ticking down in its most recent reading, the unemployment rate has risen since the middle of last year.\n\n>**Payroll gains in 2025 were very weak**. Compared to the prior ten-year average of about 1.9 million jobs created per year, payrolls increased just under 600,000 for 2025. And, **last year’s data will be revised downward soon** to likely show that there was virtually no growth in payroll employment in 2025. Zero. Zip. Nada.\n\nYes. Those are his words, quoted from his statement, on the official Federal Reserve page.\n\nJust like Powell, Waller expects payroll data to be revised downward—to the point where 2025 shows virtually no employment growth *(writing properly and using an em dash? Cue in the \"I'm an AI\" comments, for sure!)*\n\nAnd remember: Waller was on the shortlist to become the next Fed Chair.  \nWaller was also one of the two dissents in the last FOMC.\n\nYet, he didn’t mince words:\n\n>Let this sink in for a moment—**zero job growth** versus an average of almost 2 million for the 10 years prior to 2025. **This does not remotely look like a healthy labor market**.\n\nSo now we have *two* voting FOMC members—one of them aligned with the current administration—expecting a major downward payroll revision.\n\nAnd we know what revision they’re talking about.  \nIt’s the final benchmark revision, released with the January 2026 Employment Situation report.\n\n=====\n\n# Here’s When the Rewrite Drops\n\nOriginally, the report was scheduled for Friday, February 6, 2026. But due to the government shutdown, it was [postponed](https://www.bls.gov/schedule/2026/02_sched.htm) to **Wednesday, February 11, 2026 at 08:30 ET**.\n\nThat’s the setup. That’s it.\n\nAbsent a major bullish offset, a large final downward payroll revision, especially one approaching what Governor Waller is warning about, **is likely to make the market red**.\n\nNow, I’m not saying this will be the start of a crash, bubbles popping, or bear market. I’m not saying that. Heck, I’m not even expecting an actual correction.  \nBut I do believe that tomorrow, we’ll see red because of this.\n\n=====\n\nOk, so Puts the word.  \nOn who?\n\nI’m sniping stocks/ETFs that are already doing well. Sure, you could try to short software names, but they’re already in the toilet.\n\nThese are my positions, ranked by most to least exposure.  \nI’ll be honest, though. 80% of my play is on IWM.\n\nIWM Feb 11 262 Put  \nIWM Feb 13 259 Put  \nIWM Feb 13 256 Put\n\nThen, I’m testing some individual names, but these are just a couple hundred in cheap lottos since they’re like 0.10 - 0.20 per contract.\n\nTGT Feb 13 108 Put  \nSBUX Feb 13 94 Put  \nPNC Feb 13 227.5 Put  \nUSB Feb 13 57 Put  \nXLI Feb 13 167 Put\n\nI’m including the individual names in case you are hunting them, want to look cute, or you have a micro account and want to find cheap options.  \nBut for most people, you can focus on IWM.\n\nHave a nice day.", "score": 16140, "num_comments": 1128, "over_18": false, "author": "AlfrescoDog"}

Speaking at the Q2 earnings call, Tan revealed that the focus has been on developing products that cater to the needs of enterprise customers. Given the pace of hyperscaler buildout, it's fair to say demand for HDDs will only increase going forward.\n\n>Yeah, thanks, Erik. As we highlighted, we’re pretty much sold out for calendar 2026. We have firm POs with our top seven customers. And we’ve also established LTAs with two of them for calendar 2027 and one of them for calendar 2028. Obviously, these LTAs have a combination of volume of exabytes and price.\n\n>\\- WD's CEO\n\n>When we talk about major PC-first manufacturers pivoting towards AI, it is clear that demand is coming from the segment, as WD's VP of Investor Relations noted that the company's cloud revenue accounted for 89% of total revenue. In comparison, consumer revenue accounted for just 5%. When the numbers are too distant, as in WD's case, it makes sense on a business level to pivot towards enterprise demand while sidelining the client segment, as every other manufacturer is currently doing. And, in the case of Western Digital, well, this strategy is working for them.\n\n>The demand is primarily driven by the large-scale data center buildout occurring worldwide, with HDD requirements being more prevalent in US-based facilities. For those unaware, AI is nothing without data, and to store large quantities of data, CSPs use HDDs, which are the most cost-effective and efficient storage medium. The data scales to exabytes in data centers, encompassing content such as scraped web data, processed data backups, inference logs, and related data. Like AI memory, HDDs have seen massive adoption in recent years, putting suppliers under pressure.\n\n>With the AI frenzy, we have seen major PC components go into short supply, and unfortunately, this trend will persist for quite some time before we witness a meaningful recovery.", "score": 2743, "num_comments": 301, "over_18": false, "author": "callsonreddit"}

Thinking I could crack the code and become a millionaire by tapping little buttons on my phone. I started when I was 18 and the pandemic made my freshman year of college pretty lame. So figured I’d get into the stock market and get rich with my roommates. \n\nI went from penny stocks, to crypto, to options, and as you can see none of that panned out. I’d be on fire then lose it all. I worked all throughout high school and college and would constantly dump money in trying to turn it around. I came close several times, but always ended up overplaying my hand or revenge trading or being a plain old ignoramus.\n\nIt only took me 5 years to figure out full porting into short term options isn’t a good retirement plan, and 6 to figure out selling covered calls doesn’t protect you from being margin called. \n\nBut over the summer I started winning. Got in early on the OPEN pump, then the critical metals and quantum pump, and RKLB carried me to finally being all time green. Made some quick money on LUNR and now I’m all cash, waiting for something else. Just bought shares and only used options to hedge once my positions starting getting bigger. I’m terrified to losing this money, but too retarded to stop taking risks. My goal is 100k before I turn 25 which is in June, but I’m not willing to full port on margin or start doing large options plays again. We’ll see if I fuck this up.\n\nWould I do it all again? FUCK NO! That shit sucked and I spent most of my early 20s feeling like a failure. I had to get a loan from my brother bc I couldn’t pay my rent in college. My dad had a stroke and I lost the money he left me trying to get even. This shit sucked and I hope no one else experiences this ever. Anytime someone starts talking to me about trading options (bc I still love to talk about stocks) I show them this. Please don’t fuck up your financial future trying to chase some stupid earnings report. \n\nIt is really cool tho bc I became an uncle over the weekend and I was able to make a nice contribution to the kids college fund.

It’s a 2007 psychological thriller, starring Jim Carrey. In it, the protagonist, played by Carrey, becomes increasingly obsessed with the 23 enigma, noticing the number, or patterns connected to the number, everywhere in his life.\n\nThe digits of his birthday add up to 23. Assigning numbers to the letters of his name equals 23. Soon he begins breaking down license plates, prices on menus, and phone numbers, rearranging them until they add up to the number 23 all while falling deeper into paranoia based on this so-called “evidence.”\n\nI don’t really remember much of the plot beyond the obsession with the number 23. Even so, lately, I’ve been feeling more and more like Jim Carrey’s character.\n\nHowever, the symptoms of my pattern noticing haven’t resulted in the development of a dark, brooding, fractured psyche. Instead, I’d say they’re manifesting into a sort of hyperaware, *Costanzaesque* exasperated annoyance.\n\nYou see, I haven’t suddenly become obsessed with any two-digit number (although that does seem to have been in vogue recently.) \n\nNo, I’ve become obsessed with noticing the effects of Private Equity. Everywhere.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with these investment firms, they buy, invest in, or take over private companies, often with the stated goal of increasing the value of the acquired firm and then selling it at a profit, usually within 3-7 years.\n\nI won’t get into how they go about increasing the value of the businesses in their portfolio, but suffice to say, it’s usually done using rather rapacious tactics, and by exploiting some of the worst traits of modern capitalism: When they buy veterinary clinics, they [jack up](https://www.cbc.ca/news/marketplace/marketplace-vet-corporate-ownership-1.7438239) the price of treating your pet. When they take over nursing homes, they reduce patient care, [increasing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168851025001435) mortality rates. And if you work for a company that gets bought by one of these firms, you’re immediately at [higher risk](https://pestakeholder.org/private-equity-risks/effects-of-private-equity-investments/) of losing your livelihood.\n\nFortunately, I haven’t been impacted as dramatically in the ways described above.  But they have begun really, really annoying me.\n\nAnd I know this, because every time something in my life becomes 1% more annoying, like the protagonist in *The Number 23*, or more aptly, George Costanza, I can’t just chalk it up to coincidence and let it go.\n\nThe prices went up at the plumbing supply store? Private Equity bought them 24 months ago. They replaced the fresh pastries with frozen ones at the coffee shop? Private equity owns the entire chain. I stubbed my toe this morning? Although I can’t prove it, I wouldn’t be surprised if it was somehow the fault of some guy wearing a Patagonia vest in Miami.\n\nSo, in the interest of, I don’t know what exactly, here are some of the most prominent ways these companies have made my slightly less agreeable:\n\n1.     They ruined my happy place\n\nThis might sound a bit pathetic, but when I was in high school, I got a job at a self-serve Carwash. One of the perks was free Car wash tokens, and quite quickly, I realized how relaxing it could be to leave your phone at home, and spend a few minutes away from it all, absorbed in pressure washing the dirt of your car.\n\nThough I’ve long since left that job, for years, I’ve felt secure knowing that when work gets stressful, my team loses in overtime, or my girlfriend is having a K-drama night with her mom, for only a few dollars, I could forget about everything, if only for half an hour, and escape to my happy place: the self-serve carwash.\n\nOnly now I can’t.\n\nPE has been buying up carwashes across North America and “unlocking value.” The result? Instead of carelessly cruising in, it’s now like I’m crossing a military check point to get past the attendant. No, I don’t need the wax, or a 7$ air freshener. No, I don’t need the ultra-wash package, just the basic (which is now 20% more expensive.) And no, I don’t want to download an app, or sign up to a subscription service. This isn’t a tech start up.\n\n2.     No more simple business names\n\nThese firms keep buying up mom-and-pop shops, “rolling them up” into a bigger conglomerate, and enjoying the economies of scale.\n\nBeyond the negative effects this has on consumers (monopoly pricing power, reducing services in less profitable areas) and employees (They no longer need 10 accounting departments, just 1, here is your pink slip), I’ve also noticed they change the names and logos.\n\nNo more Kowalski and Sons HVAC, or Ms. Wilson’s tailoring. No more logos made by someone’s nephew who had a knack for drawing.\n\nNow every company’s name and logo look like some hyper modern sterile data analytics company, and I no longer know what a company does just by seeing their name or logo on a truck or storefront.\n\n3.     My friend Brandon is annoying now \n\nRemember your friend from high school that never took notes, was in all the advanced classes, helped everyone with their homework and effortlessly made straight As?\n\nThat was my friend Brandon. I ran into him a few months ago. I was sure he was doing something great. Was he curing cancer? Building bridges? Revolutionizing a new industry? \n\nNo, none of that. Like a lot of today’s best and brightest, he spends ten hours a day aligning spreadsheets and talking about deal flow. We chatted for a few minutes, and though I can forgive him for using his talents to make a handsome salary, I can’t forgive what a few years in a PE firm has done to his vocabulary. “Synergy,” “Platform Investment,” “White space opportunity.,” “De-risk the exit.”  Dude, we’re in a line up for a Costco hotdog and I just asked you what you’ve been up to.\n\n4.     They’re somehow making youth sports even MORE unaffordable\n\nYears ago, my best friend opened a barber shop, and the very first thing he did when the shop was financially stable, was to sponsor his local soccer team and pay for their jerseys.\n\nIt wasn’t a complicated business decision. There was no ROI consideration. My friend just loves soccer ( perhaps worryingly so when it comes to Messi and the Argentinean national team) and he wanted to support the game locally. \n\nIt was like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting.\n\nEver since, when I see a business logo on a local sports jersey, I make a point to look it up. Not once have I seen a PE-backed firm sponsor a local team, or support a community run event. \n\nThey have, however, started buying up local hockey rinks, banning spectators from filming, and charging parents a subscription fee to get access to game recordings.\n\n5.     No more free samples\n\nI’ve never been a fan of shopping, in particular, grocery shopping. I don’t like the lines. I hate the reminder that I have no self-control, whenever I walk by the chip aisle. And lately, I’ve not been so happy about how much I have to spend to get so little.\n\nBut I LOVE free samples. It’s one of life’s little pleasures. Mozzarella sticks? Chicken wings? A new line of sweet and sour marinades that I will never buy? Free samples made trips to the grocery store all worth it.\n\nAs PE firms have been buying up local grocery stores, local speciality stores, and food distribution businesses, I’ve seen a dramatic decrease in cheerful elderly women offering me pieces of cheese on toothpicks.\n\nFor a while, I assumed it was some post-covid by-law, until I got offered a sample of wine at my local liquor store and remembered how much I missed those samples.\n\nThough I can’t prove it, I suspect that the rise of Private Equity, means that some consultant has calculated there is a higher ROI on selling ranch dressing by using coupons or digitally targeted ads than allowing someone a free snack when they shop.\n\nAs the old saying goes there are no free lunches”. But for a moment in time, there was a lot of free samples.\n\n6.     I can’t wear a vest anymore\n\nI’m not a fashionista. In fact, I have no sense of fashion. But for a while I found vests pretty comfortable and added a little *je ne sais quoi* to my outfits.\n\nEver since PE firms have begun extracting value in the nursing home, I don’t want to wear one, lest people mistake me for someone who thought that the number of grandparents surviving in long term care homes wasn’t economically optimized.\n\nI concede that a lot of my complaints are banal when it comes to the big picture. The rising inequality, the precariousness of modern jobs, the introduction of the profit motive into many of the services we rely on. That’s all much more concerning than the absence of a free jalapeno popper while I look for the Greek yogurt.\n\nStill, I miss those jalapeno poppers.", "score": 699, "num_comments": 110, "over_18": false, "author": "ChickenLumpy378"}

He also hinted that the absence of a deal could force very harsh action.\n\nThis is not coming out of nowhere. During his previous term, Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal, reimposed heavy sanctions, and authorized the strike that killed IRGC commander Qassem Soleimani in 2020. That period saw oil spikes, tanker seizures in the Strait of Hormuz, and sharp volatility across global markets.\n\nRight now diplomatically, talks remain fragile. Iran continues uranium enrichment at levels far above the original deal caps. Israel has been openly signaling readiness to act if diplomacy fails. The US has already increased naval presence in the region over the past year, mainly as deterrence but also as contingency positioning.\n\nSo the question becomes what path this actually leads to.\n\nOption 1\n\nTrump keeps delaying a strike because he ultimately wants leverage, not war. Military threats are negotiation tools aimed at forcing Iran back into a restrictive nuclear deal.\n\nOption 2\n\nDelays are operational, not diplomatic. The US builds force presence, coordinates with Israel, and prepares for a large scale assault targeting nuclear infrastructure and possibly regime stability.\n\nOption 3\n\nA hybrid path. Limited strikes on nuclear or missile sites followed by rapid diplomatic outreach to lock in concessions while Iran is weakened.\n\nEach path carries very different market consequences.\n\nOil is the most immediate transmission channel. Any escalation near the Strait of Hormuz threatens roughly a fifth of global crude flows. That risk alone can send Brent sharply higher. Defence stocks historically rally on escalation cycles while airlines and transport names come under pressure. Gold and the dollar tend to catch safe haven flows while emerging markets usually see capital outflows.\n\nCurious how everyone here sees this being priced. Is this headline noise markets will fade, or the early stage of a geopolitical risk premium building into energy, equities, and volatility.\n\nSources to this", "score": 531, "num_comments": 178, "over_18": false, "author": "vishesh_07_028"}

The data paints an interesting picture for anyone considering China tech exposure.  \nSince DeepSeek demonstrated that frontier AI could be trained for a fraction of US costs, Chinese tech stocks have added over $1.3 trillion in market cap as of Feb 2025. The Hang Seng Tech Index gained 23% in 2025, yet it still trades below its historical median P/E multiple. At the start of 2026, Goldman Sachs explicitly recommended 'overweighting Chinese equities' in its latest research report. Meanwhile, several other global institutions, including Fidelity International, UBS, and Invesco, have also expressed a bullish outlook on Chinese assets for the year ahead.\n\nThe more compelling story is in the domestic AI chip ecosystem. Cambricon Technologies, which makes chips that DeepSeek's models natively support, guided full year 2025 revenue of 6 to 7 billion yuan, up over 410% from 1.17 billion yuan in 2024, with net profit of 1.85 to 2.15 billion yuan versus a loss of 452 million yuan the prior year, marking its first annual profit since listing. The company currently trades at a market cap of roughly $60 billion, down from a peak above $70 billion. Several other AI chip companies including Biren, MetaX, and Baidu's Kunlun chip unit are reportedly preparing IPOs.\n\nWhat makes the timing interesting is the growing speculation around DeepSeek's next major release. The R2 model was originally expected in mid-2025 but was delayed after founder Liang Wenfeng expressed dissatisfaction with performance. Part of the challenge was training difficulties on Huawei's Ascend chips, as Chinese authorities encouraged the company to reduce Nvidia dependence. They reportedly had to pivot back to Nvidia for training while using Huawei chips for inference.\n\nHowever, DeepSeek published a research paper on January 1st introducing a new training architecture that analysts describe as a breakthrough for scaling larger models more efficiently. Some analysts believe there may not be a standalone R2 and instead the improvements will be integrated into a V4 model. DeepSeek has historically published foundational research papers shortly before major model launches, so the timing is notable.\n\nThere's also chatter about a next-generation AI agent capable of executing multi-step tasks autonomously, potentially launching in Q1 2026. If DeepSeek manages another \"Sputnik moment\" with a new model release, it could drive another leg of re-rating across Chinese tech.\n\nFrom a portfolio construction perspective, the challenge is that most China tech ETFs available to US investors have limited exposure to the companies actually benefiting from this trend. KWEB has zero A-share exposure and is concentrated in internet names. CQQQ has broader coverage but caps A-share weight at 25% due to index rules. I've been looking at CNQQ which has roughly 50% A-share weight and actually holds names like Cambricon and other AI chip plays that are missing from the internet-focused funds. It's a newer fund so less liquidity, but the exposure profile is closer to what I'm looking for if the thesis is about AI infrastructure buildout rather than just consumer internet.\n\nThe risks are real and include regulatory uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and currency exposure. But the valuation gap versus US tech and the potential catalyst from new model releases make this worth watching.", "score": 125, "num_comments": 67, "over_18": false, "author": "Top-Cardiologist1011"}
