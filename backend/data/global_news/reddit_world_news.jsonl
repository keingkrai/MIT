Nvidia is sitting at roughly $4.62 Trillion while Google is at $3.99 Trillion. The magic number Google needs to hit to surpass Nvidia is $380.50. That is just a 15.8% move from the current price of roughly $328 based on the close numbers.\n\nRemember what happened when Nvidia first took the top spot? It wasn't just a number, it was a psychological trigger. The moment they hit #1, every news outlet ran the headline, ETFs rebalanced, and retail chased the winner. Right now is that same wave for Google that is building up.  Once **across $380.50, the \"Google is King\" headlines start**, and the momentum buying kicks in. \n\n**The Apple capitulation leading to mobile dominance**\n\nApple announced Gemini is going to be the default native AI for Siri. Think about the distribution monopoly they just secured. They have Gemini native on 3 billion Android devices, and now they have integration across 1.5 billion iOS devices. Google now owns the AI layer on **100% of the mobile distribution channel**. No other competitor exists at this scale. They have effectively checkmated the entire edge consumer AI market.\n\n**They are cloud leaders**\n\nGoogle Cloud revenue is accelerating at a rate that is frankly terrifying for Amazon and Microsoft. We are talking about parabolic revenue expansion driven by AI infrastructure demand.  \nQ3 2025 Revenue: $15.15 billion (up **34% year-over-year**).  \nAnnualized Run Rate: The business is running at an annual pace of roughly $61 billion.  \nOperating Income: A record $3.59 billion for the third quarter, representing a 23.7% operating margin, indicating rapidly increasing profitability.  \nGoogle Cloud ended Q3 2025 with a **$155 billion backlog.**\n\n  \n**They are entertainment leaders**\n\nYoutube surpassed Netflix (and all other streaming services)  \nAccording to the latest Nielsen Gauge report, YouTube captured 13.4% of total TV time, Netflix at 8.8%. Also Netflix: 325M subscribers come for a specific show and siappear when it;s over (like now with stranger things) while YouTube which has 2 Billion users who keep coming back to long form and shorts from never ending list of creators the algorithm know they would like.   \n  \n**Google has it's own silicon**\n\nGoogle has been building its own TPUs for a decade, meaning they don't pay the \"Nvidia Tax\" that crushes other tech companies margins.\n\nGoogle can later on sell these chips to other hyperscalers. Can you imagine Microsoft or Meta running on Google silicon? If they confirm this new revenue stream the stock goes nuclear. They instantly become a potential top-tier AI chip supplier with massive margins, they even go for rent model like IREN or CRWV. This is a multi-billion dollar catalyst that is currently not being priced.\n\n**Even the valuation show's google is STILL mispriced**\n\nRight now the market is paying a massive premium for Nvidia's future while ignoring Google's present cash flow.\n\nLook at the P/E ratio comparison. Google 32.6x P/E. For Nvidia,45.8x P/E. **That makes Google roughly 29% cheaper on PE valuation basis.**\n\nIf Google were simply valued at the same multiple as Nvidia, its stock price would be roughly $460. to hit $400 target, al is needed is taht the valuation gap to narrow slightly.\n\n**Wall Street is quietly loading up**\n\nRaymond James just upgraded to a Strong Buy with a $400 target. Pivotal Research reaffirmed their Buy rating with a $400 target. Canaccord raised their target to $390. they are all converging on the same number right before the earnings.\n\n**The non digital assets**\n\nPixel 10 sales were up 28% year-over-year in September, capturing **7% of the US premium market** and stealing share directly from Samsung. And Waymo driverless taxi is no longer a side project. They are doing **450,000 paid rides** per week. They are live in Phoenix, SF, LA, and expanding fast. \n\n**TLDR**\n\nGoogle is winning on search, youtube, ads, cloud, AI Chip, driverless cars, mobile phones and is about to become the world's most valuable company.\n\n**On Feb 4th earnings call it will surge to the crossover point at $380.50 and after the call continue to $400.**\n\n\\*I’m holding 10k USD worth of $375C for Feb 6. I am calling Google at $400. I know that most of you are holding GOOG, so good luck tp us all.\n\nNext earnings: Alphabet Inc.

This is evident from their most recent investment overview, which ABP always publishes with a three-month delay.\n\n> At the end of March, the value of US government bonds in ABP's books was still more than €29 billion. At the end of September, ABP was lending only €19 billion to the US, more than a third less.\n\n> Experts believe that such a rapid reduction reflects a lack of confidence in the financial stability of the US. The billions that are no longer invested in US government bonds are instead being lent to the Netherlands and Germany. During the same period, ABP lent an additional €3 billion to the Netherlands and more than €6 billion to Germany.\n\n> In an interview with Fox News yesterday, Trump threatened “major retaliation” if European countries sell US stocks or bonds. With around €500 billion in pension funds, ABP is the largest fund in the Netherlands and also an important institutional investor worldwide.\n\n> **Multiple factors**\n\n> The question is whether ABP is deliberately withdrawing money from America or whether the amount lent has decreased in value. Rising interest rates on government bonds, for example, can depress their value. In addition, the new Dutch pension system may also play a role. Pension funds are now allowed to invest more riskily than before and are therefore likely to be selling off relatively safe bonds.\n\n> In this case, the higher interest rates are not playing a major role, according to pension experts. Shortly after Trump's announcement of import tariffs in April 2025, bond interest rates rose sharply, but that increase has been virtually wiped out. So that would only explain to a very limited extent why US bonds are recorded at a much lower value, says Bas Werker, professor of pensions and affiliated with the pension think tank Netspar.\n\n> Nor does the phasing out of bonds due to the new pension system seem to be on the agenda at ABP, according to Jacintha van Bijnen of pension advisor AON: “If you exchange US bonds for European bonds, you are not disposing of bonds.”\n\n> **Selling**\n\n> ABP's deliberate policy, i.e., selling or not repurchasing, therefore seems to play a major role. “Trump's unpredictability, and in a broader sense the increasing geopolitical uncertainty, are leading pension funds to take a more critical look than before at their financial and non-financial resilience,” says Pim Zomerdijk of investment advisor Sprenkels.\n\n> ABP refuses to say whether US bonds have been sold off because of Trump's policies. A spokesperson said that they could not comment on recent transactions or investment strategy in order to “protect the interests of our participants.” Such information could prompt competing investors to sell, which could reduce the value of the investment.\n\n> ABP seeks stability in order to invest and protect pension funds effectively. “That is what our investment mix is aimed at,” said the spokesperson. Government bonds are generally considered to be a hedge against sharp fluctuations in the stock markets and currencies.\n\n> **US debt**\n\n> For decades, the US has been considered the safe haven of the financial world, but rising government spending is increasing the national debt. This is raising doubts about whether America is still able to repay those debts.\n\n> High debt is not a problem as long as enough countries, investors, and individuals are willing to hold dollars. Trump's import tariffs are putting pressure on trade with other countries. Since his second term as president, the value of the dollar has fallen by more than 10 percent.\n\n> Trump is also putting pressure on the central bank, the Fed, to lower interest rates and is threatening to dismiss Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. This fall, the Dutch Central Bank also warned of the risk of financial instability and weaker US government bonds.\n\n> **Danish pension funds**\n\n> This week, it was announced that two pension funds from Denmark have sold their US government bonds. These are funds in which teachers and academics accrue pension rights. A pension fund from Greenland has also said it wants to withdraw investments from the US in response to Trump's threat to take Greenland.\n\n> “This decision is the result of weak US public finances,” said Anders Schelde, head of investments at the Danish teachers' pension fund. According to him, it is a matter of risk management. The money is now being invested in less risky investments.\n\n> Like ABP, the Danish teachers' pension fund says that the disposal of US debt securities is not directly linked to the rising tensions between the US and Europe. Nevertheless, the two cannot be viewed entirely separately: “Of course, that doesn't make it any easier to take such a decision,” said Schelde.\n\nI thought this part was interesting;\n\n> ABP refuses to say whether US bonds have been sold off because of Trump's policies. A spokesperson said that they could not comment on recent transactions or investment strategy in order to “protect the interests of our participants.” Such information could prompt competing investors to sell, which could reduce the value of the investment.\n\nRefusing to comment as to why, sounds like they're planning to sell off more?", "score": 2031, "num_comments": 117, "over_18": false, "author": "Antique-Special8025"}

The government agreed to pay $277mn for the equity, giving it an implied gain of $490mn for the equity and warrants based on the current share price of $24.77.\n\nUSA Rare Earth will also receive $1.3bn in senior secured debt financing at market rates from the government. The money will come from a finance facility created for the commerce department as part of the CHIPS and Science Act passed in 2022. A commerce official said the department completed the transaction directly with the company.\n\nTalks progressed rapidly this week as investor interest returned to critical mineral stocks after President Donald Trump said Washington had reached the “framework” for a deal that could include access to Greenland’s untapped critical mineral wealth. One person familiar with the situation noted that the USA Rare Earth deal was unrelated to Greenland.\n\nUSA Rare Earth declined to comment. The commerce department declined to discuss the deal. But an official in the Chips office — a part of the commerce department housed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology that led the negotiations — said it was “focused on onshoring critical and strategic mineral essential to the semiconductor supply chain and US national security”.\n\nUSA Rare Earth has separately tapped Cantor Fitzgerald, the Wall Street firm previously owned by commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and now run by his sons, to raise more than $1bn in fresh equity financing, the people said. It is not directly related to the deal with the government.\n\nThe deal marks the latest example of the Trump administration’s efforts to intervene in parts of the private sector viewed as critical to US national security, including taking a 10 per cent stake in chipmaker Intel and negotiating a so-called golden-share agreement in US Steel.\n\nUSA Rare Earth, which has a market value of $3.7bn, is developing a huge mine in Sierra Blanca, Texas that it says contains 15 of the 17 rare earth elements underpinning production of cell phones, missiles and fighter jets. It also plans to open a magnet production facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma.\n\nLast year, the Trump administration invested in at least six minerals companies, including MP Materials, Trilogy Metals and Lithium Americas.\n\nSome of the investments overlapped with the financial interests of people associated with the administration. The government did a funding deal with Vulcan Elements, a rare earths start-up three months after the president’s son Donald Trump Jr’s venture capital group invested in the company.\n\nThe commerce department and defence department have worked closely together to financially boost domestic rare earth production.\n\nA condition of the government investment in USA Rare Earth was that the company raise at least an additional $500mn from investors. It is on track to raise more than $1bn because of high demand for the financing deal, which uses a mechanism known as a private investment into a public equity, often called a “Pipe”.\n\nCantor’s involvement comes as the investment bank once led by Lutnick, one of Trump’s most prominent cabinet members, has expanded its investment banking capabilities to benefit from the president’s “America first” agenda.

Value Matters\n\nBritish Stocks have a lower average P/E ratio versus the S&P500s, with an average P/E of 17 to the S&P's 28.  This is typically due to lower growth estimates and a smaller tech stack. British infrastructure stocks have announced record investment in recent years, and will still provide their relatively larger dividends.\n\n2. AI Insulation\n\nThe IMF issued a warning this week about the effect of a pop in a potential AI bubble. US stocks are of course the most exposed to any potential AI downside and are relying on strong earnings reports this year.\n\n3. Long Term Stability\n\nTrump's stance on Greenland has provided a unifying point for European politics. The effect Trump had on switching the outcome of the latest Canadian election, is being seen to a lesser extent across nations in Europe.\n\n4. Improving Regulatory Outlook\n\nAt Davos this week Macron highlighted Europe's overregulation. This being brought up so publicly creates positive sentiment towards improved offerings across the continent and highlights recent genuine measures to cut red tape.\n\n5. Trumpism\n\nAs an outsider with no skin in the game I was concerned watching Biden's performance degrade over his term. Did Biden's health and performance improve over his presidency? Why would President Trump's be any different?\n\nIf threatening to invade allies is Trump's Year 1, how exposed do I want to be to his year 4?\n\nIn the FTSE, your portfolio will be better insulated from Trump's degrading mental health:  \n\\-You are not going to have your stock's key product banned overnight (wind turbines)  \n\\-Or key manufaturing imports tariffed (Canada's automotive imputs)  \n\\-Nor will you be caught on the wrong side of one of their more apparent government back pump and dumps.  \n\\-For as long as Trump is in power, he is unpredictable, but predictably more volatile as he gets older. \n\nTLDR; I am bullish on Europe, because Trumps degrading of American assets is either directly benefiting the Europeans, or scaring the Europeans into action.

As many have pointed out, these are safe haven assets. When there is turmoil in the world, when the value of government currencies are uncertain, equities are uncertain, this is where the money flows. Can't make more of it, no government can affect it, can hold, can travel.\n\nEDIT Previous highs, like the 70's, functioned in this way. Gold at all time highs. Equities in the cellar, bonds in the cellar. The dollar was weak and losing credibility — that's what drove gold up. Critically, central banks weren't buying gold back then — many were selling or holding, believing the price had gotten too high. The rally was driven purely by private investors panicking about inflation. Eventually, Volcker jacked rates to 20%, which crushed inflation, strengthened the dollar, and brought strong demand for US treasury bills back. Gold then entered a 20-year bear market, with central banks continuing to sell throughout the 80s and 90s (most famously, the UK dumped half its reserves at the bottom in 1999).\n\nIn the 70's we were in stagflation (high inflation low growth) in the US though, so interest rates were rising to try to limit inflation, but inflation remained high and growth was low... so demand for t bills was still weak, high inflation. So the fed made a crazy move - pegged interest to 20%. This killed inflation, and brought strong interest back to the dollar, and gold went into a 20 year decline.\n\nThey can't do that anymore. The US has gotten into a situation where the treasury needs to service debt more than a third of our annual GDP. How do we service that debt? We issue more bonds. If those bonds paid 20%, we'd go bankrupt.\n\nSo back to the beginning, what's special about right now. We have never had this situation. Equities are near all time highs. CAPE, which measures P/E ratio of the market, is over 40 for the second time in history, implying very high valuations. The buffet factor, which compares GDP to the value of stocks is at 224%, the highest ever. And we know metals are also at ATH's. What is happening?\n\nEveryone knows the fed sets interest rates, but in the 90's, Japan taught all the feds around the world a new trick. Treasury issues bonds. Fed buys them. They just create the money and give it to the treasury. They collect payments. Then they send the interest collected back to the treasury. US does this the most, but everyone has allowed it because there's no better currency.\n\nWhen COVID hit, the fed kicked this into high gear to prevent recession. In one month, they bought $1.3T of bonds (April 2020). They agree to buy $120B per month thereafter. In the last five years, the money in the world has increased from $15T >>> $22T. This is unprecedented, and rightfully so, countries' central banks were feeling like the dollar may be a little less safe if they're just going apeshit printing money. (Also that COVID money went straight to people via stimulus checks and PPP \"loans\" that were forgiven --->> all that extra money drove up equities, properties, groceries... it's the root of the hyper inflation.)\n\nOk we're almost there. 2022. Russia invades Ukraine. US freezes $300B of Russia's dollars. OH shit the dollar isn't what it used to be they are printing it like mad and if they don't like us they can just cancel it. Central banks changed their rainy day fund strategy. Instead of buying \\~400 tons of gold per year (about 12% of demand) they started buying 1200 tons - 25% of demand in 2024. Now they are buying 900. They are only buying less because the price is up, they don't care about the price they are buying anyway. Jewelry is still buying the same 1200 tons regardless of price. Retail is buying 1000 tons because of the same reason central banks are, and industry can't buy less.\n\nThey are buying less treasury bonds.  So the dollar has fallen 15% in the last year.  Tariffs just making it worse for the dollar.\n\nSo why would this stop? US deficit just got way bigger with the big beautiful bill. Which means more t bills, and the interest rate is starting to divorce from fed rate changes because there is too much supply. They can't raise interest rates like the 70's. If stagflation hits (low growth, high unemployment AND high inflation) we are fucked. Remember our clever friend Japan? Well they just kept buying their t bills. Then they started buying nikkei stocks too. They hold 226% of their gdp in debt, interest is zero, and the yen is cratering. (One of the only places to take your dollar on vacation right now, FYI.)\n\nStocks WILL drop - who knows when exactly, but the highest CAPE ever was 44 in the dotcom era, we're at 40+.  Oh and another record - $1.3T of those stocks are leveraged. When the drop happens where is the safe haven now? Dollar is no longer safe haven. This is why I think gold, silver, platinum could double again.\n\nSide note: as soon as the world accepts bitcoin does in fact check every box gold does in these situations I think it goes apeshit too. Signs are already there - in October is started behaving a little differently - it's not a high risk asset that should track equities, it's a safety asset. Quantum computing the core risk there IMO.", "score": 146, "num_comments": 122, "over_18": false, "author": "shiithead_007"}
