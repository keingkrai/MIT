And it seems that over time, a lot of the people who gave the company a hefty deposit—some say interest-free loan—have become tired of waiting and want their money back.And that’s not quite so easy, it turns out. Musk’s current Silicon Valley rival is the latest to discover this. According to Sam Altman’s social media account, he placed an order for a Roadster on July 11, 2018, with a deposit of $45,000 ($58,206 in today’s money). But after emailing Tesla for a refund, he discovered the email address associated with preorders had been deleted.”#TeslaRoadster #TSLA https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/sam-altman-wants-a-refund-for-his-50000-tesla-roadster-deposit/", "url": "https://mstdn.fname.ca/@crispius/115480620573913365", "id": "115480620984143683", "source": "mastodon#hashtag", "symbol": "TSLA"}
