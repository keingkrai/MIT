        "validation_notes": "Raw intelligence contradicts the SELL thesis. Technicals show a strong bullish trend (price above all key SMAs, MACD bullish crossover, VWMA confirming volume-supported uptrend) with sentiment 'Bullish' and momentum 'Strong'. Fundamentals highlight exceptional profitability and cash flow, not just overvaluation. News is mixed but includes positive catalysts (China sales, Fitness+ expansion, Fed rate cut). The plan incorrectly frames technical strength as 'overbought exhaustion' and overemphasizes valuation while ignoring strong trend and positive catalysts."

Entry at 275 targets the 50 SMA and prior support, improving risk/reward. Stop below the Bollinger lower band. Primary risk is valuation compression on earnings disappointment; monitor RSI for overbought conditions above 70."
