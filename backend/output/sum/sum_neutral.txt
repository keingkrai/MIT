The Neutral view suggests a wait-and-see approach due to conflicting signals: strong fundamentals and favorable short-term technicals point to upward momentum, yet persistent long-term headwinds and market volatility temper enthusiasm. While aggressive entry risks exposure to unforeseen corrections, excessive caution may result in missed opportunities amid demonstrable near-term strength. This creates a delicate risk-reward tension—potential gains must be weighed against downside vulnerability. A prudent compromise involves initiating a reduced position size to participate in upside without overcommitting, coupled with a disciplined stop-loss placed just below key support levels. This strategy balances engagement with protection, enabling timely exits if sentiment shifts, and allows for recalibration based on evolving market conditions. Accumulate only on confirmed dips.
