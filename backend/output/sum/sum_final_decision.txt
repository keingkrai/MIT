Trade REJECTED due to material financial vulnerability, unresolved legal exposure, and technical stagnation despite speculative growth narratives. The decision to SELL is underpinned by a high conviction that the debt-to-equity ratio of 2.32 presents a critical leverage risk, particularly amid rising rate environments or economic stress, while the ongoing class-action lawsuit remains a potent catalyst for sharp downside. Technicals confirm consolidation near the 50-day SMA with no breakout momentum, and resistance at $71.95 remains intact—invalidating any notion of imminent upside. The 'Risky' analyst’s optimism around digital innovation and China demand fails to offset these concrete, quantifiable risks. Execution guardrails mandate a full market sell order to eliminate exposure; no partial exit is permitted. A hard stop loss is implicitly enforced via immediate exit, with re-entry strictly contingent upon a confirmed breakout above $71.95 on strong volume, accompanied by a demonstrable drop in leverage and a favorable legal resolution. The critical invalidating condition is the absence of both a resolved legal posture and a sustained technical breakout—until then, the position must remain closed to preserve capital.
