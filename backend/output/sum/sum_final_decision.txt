Trade REJECTED due to overwhelming long-term structural risks and confluence of technical resistance; the decision to SELL all holdings is mandated to preserve capital. The risk rationale centers on irreversible secular shifts in consumer demand toward healthier alternatives, compounded by deteriorating fundamentals—elevated leverage, declining volumes, and reliance on unsustainable pricing—outweighing transient technical momentum. Conviction is high, as the Safe Analyst’s warnings about upper Bollinger Band resistance at 71.88 being a likely reversal point are validated by the absence of sustainable breakout catalysts. No position size or entry zone applies, as the plan is immediate full liquidation with no re-entry contemplated until material business model transformation occurs. The critical invalidating condition is any evidence of genuine, scalable innovation in product diversification and volume growth independent of price hikes—until then, the position remains closed and the risk profile unacceptable.
