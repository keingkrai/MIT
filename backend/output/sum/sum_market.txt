Technically Bullish, KO exhibits a short-term uptrend supported by price holding above the 10-day EMA, 50-day SMA, and VWMA, while the MACD line (0.1168) remains above its signal (-0.0714) with a positive histogram (0.1882), signaling strengthening bullish momentum; the RSI at 52.94 confirms neutral conditions without overbought extremes, and moderate ATR (0.9239) reflects steady volatility. Price trades near the upper end of its recent range at 70.44, just below the upper Bollinger Band at 71.88, facing resistance there and at 71.00, while key support lies at 70.00 and 69.00. Despite the bullish alignment across indicators, the lack of strong conviction in RSI and proximity to resistance suggest caution. Wait for a pullback to 70.00–70.25 on moderate volume before entering long positions.
