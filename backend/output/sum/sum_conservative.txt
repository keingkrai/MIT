The Conservative view strongly advises caution due to the fragile nature of the current market setup, where apparent momentum masks deeper structural vulnerabilities. Elevated valuations, combined with persistent macro headwinds such as shifting consumer demand toward healthier alternatives and intensifying competitive pressures, suggest limited upside and heightened downside exposure. The technical structure is particularly precarious, with the upper Bollinger Band at 71.88 acting as a critical resistance level that, if breached, could trigger a rapid reversal. Underlying fragility is amplified by moderate volatility and the ever-present risk of unforeseen catalysts—be it a sudden economic contraction or adverse regulatory intervention—that could swiftly erode gains. Given these uncertainties and the asymmetric risk profile, any exposure must be minimized through strict position sizing or tight stop-loss protection. Prioritize cash and await clearer signals before committing capital.
