The Aggressive view strongly advocates for immediate entry, dismissing cautious narratives as outdated distractions from the undeniable momentum building beneath the surface—technical indicators are flashing buy signals with price decisively above key moving averages, MACD momentum accelerating, and RSI holding firm without overbought extremes. This isn’t a speculative gamble; it’s a calculated bet on a hidden squeeze potential fueled by suppressed short interest and rising institutional accumulation, amplified by FOMO-driven retail participation. While skeptics fret over distant consumer shifts, the real story is today’s cash flow strength, fair valuation, and improving sentiment creating an asymmetric reward profile: modest downside risk capped by fundamentals, but explosive upside if momentum carries through earnings or a catalyst-driven breakout. The critical trigger? A sustained close above resistance with volume confirmation—once achieved, the move could accelerate rapidly, turning conviction into compounding returns.
