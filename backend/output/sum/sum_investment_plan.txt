The plan is to SELL Coca-Cola immediately, driven by a convergence of material financial and operational risks that outweigh its enduring brand strengths. Despite consistent profitability and free cash flow, the company’s elevated debt-to-equity ratio of 2.32 poses a critical vulnerability, especially under potential rate hikes, while ongoing litigation and reputational exposure create tangible downside pressure. Technical indicators confirm indecision—trading in a narrow range with resistance near $71.90, neutral RSI, and fading MACD momentum—signaling no imminent breakout despite bullish narratives around new leadership and product innovation. These strategic initiatives, though promising, remain speculative and carry high execution risk without near-term catalysts to justify holding. The urgency to act stems from the deteriorating risk-reward profile, where downside risks are concrete and measurable, while upside is uncertain and delayed. The primary risk that would invalidate this plan is a rapid deleveraging through asset sales or financing restructuring that significantly reduces debt burden and resolves legal exposure, thereby restoring investor confidence and enabling a sustained recovery in valuation.
